# File Download - Shared Memory Transport Example

This example demonstrates server-side streaming for large file downloads over the shared memory transport.

## Features

- Server-side streaming for downloading large files
- Demonstrates chunked data transfer over shared memory
- Shows metadata + data streaming pattern

## Running the Example

### Start the Server

```bash
cd Server
dotnet run
```

### Run the Client (in a separate terminal)

```bash
cd Client
dotnet run
```

## What it Demonstrates

1. **Server-Side Streaming**: Streaming large files from server to client
2. **Chunked Transfer**: Sending files in chunks to manage memory efficiently
3. **Metadata + Data Pattern**: Sending file metadata first, then data chunks

## Memory Behavior for Large Payloads

- The server reads and sends file data in fixed-size chunks (`32 KB`) instead of buffering entire files.
- The client writes each received chunk directly to disk.
- This keeps memory usage bounded for large downloads and avoids full-payload buffering.

## Shared Memory Transport

This example uses the shared memory transport instead of TCP for ultra-low latency
same-machine communication. This is particularly useful for large file transfers
between processes on the same machine, avoiding TCP overhead.

The transport is Windows-only for now.
