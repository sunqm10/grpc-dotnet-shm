/// Receive-side dispatcher that distributes inbound frames across a small
/// fixed number of "stripe" workers so the SHM reader thread no longer
/// fans out to N per-stream channels on its own thread of execution.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Why this exists. The previous design had the single SHM reader Thread
/// call <c>stream._inboundFrames.Writer.TryWrite(frame)</c> for every
/// inbound frame. For the high-concurrency tiny-payload cell
/// (1000 streams x 64 B ping-pong) that is one
/// <c>ThreadPool.UnsafeQueueUserWorkItem</c> per frame because the
/// per-stream channel's <c>MRVTSCore.SetResult</c> hits a registered
/// awaiter. The accumulated dispatch cost (~0.5-1 us per frame on Linux,
/// ~17 us per frame on Windows where the threadpool worker wake is more
/// expensive) is the ONLY cell where SHM lost to UDS in the apples-to-
/// apples fair-default bench. Kestrel's <c>System.IO.Pipelines.Pipe</c>
/// dispatch path is more tightly optimised by the .NET runtime team and
/// pays ~0.5-1 us less per frame on this exact pattern.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The striper changes the pattern. The reader thread now does only
/// frame-header parse plus a single <c>TryWrite</c> into one of N
/// per-stripe SPSC queues, picked by a Knuth multiplicative hash of
/// <c>streamId</c>. Each stripe owns a dedicated Thread that consumes
/// the queue and invokes <c>stream.OnFrameReceived(frame)</c> inline.
/// Because the stripe is the single writer of the per-stream
/// <c>Channel&lt;InboundFrame&gt;</c>, the per-stream channel is created
/// with <c>AllowSynchronousContinuations=true</c>, so the user's
/// awaiter continuation runs inline on the stripe thread — zero
/// ThreadPool dispatch in the steady state.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Why 4 stripes. On a 16-core target, 4 stripes is enough to remove
/// the single-receive-dispatcher bottleneck while leaving cores for the
/// reader, writer, ThreadPool, and application continuations. More
/// stripes add cache churn and wake overhead before they help any cell
/// we care about. The stripe count is a power of two so the hash
/// selector can be a single AND mask.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Head-of-line blocking. A single stripe serves ~250 streams in the
/// 1000-stream bench. A slow user continuation blocks the other ~249
/// streams in that stripe but not the other 750. The previous fan-out
/// design had 0 % HOL exposure but paid the dispatch tax on every
/// frame; this design has 25 % HOL exposure for grossly misbehaving
/// user code in exchange for the dispatch cost reclaim.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Frame ownership. The reader thread transfers ownership of the
/// <see cref="FramePayload"/> to the striper at <see cref="Enqueue"/>.
/// On dispatch, ownership transfers to <c>ShmGrpcStream.OnFrameReceived</c>
/// (which transfers it again to the per-stream Channel on success, or
/// releases on failure). On stripe shutdown, any frame that was
/// queued but never dispatched is released by the stripe shutdown
/// drain loop. On <see cref="ReceiveStriper"/> dispose after the
/// disposed flag has been observed, the calling reader thread releases
/// the payload itself before returning.
